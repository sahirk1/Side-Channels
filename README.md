# Side-Channels

The goal of this project was to write side channel exploits for a system, to analyze its vulnerabilities

A side channel attack is any attack based on information gained from the implementation of a computer system, rather 
than weaknesses in the implemented algorithm itself. In this project, time and memory based side channel attacks are 
demonstrated. These are available in timehack.c and memhack.c respectively
